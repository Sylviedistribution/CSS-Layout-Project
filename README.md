This was my first practical project using CSS. I learned a lot throughout the process, even though I forgot to initialize Git at the beginning—so the commits you’ll see start with a big part of the project, the layout and CSS. I’ll make sure not to forget that next time.

For this project, I challenged myself to replicate the home page of the Docplanner website.
It gave me a great opportunity to practice both HTML structure with the semantic tag like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section> and CSS layout techniques, especially using Flexbox and Grid.
I also integrated Font Awesome icons and focused on styling elements effectively to match the original design as closely as possible.

I also set the media queries for the responsivity on the web page.
