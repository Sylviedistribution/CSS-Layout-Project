This was my first practical project using CSS. I learned a lot throughout the process, even though I forgot to initialize Git at the beginning—so the only commit you’ll see is my initial one. I’ll make sure not to forget that next time.

For this project, I challenged myself to replicate the home page of the Docplanner website.
It gave me a great opportunity to practice both HTML structure with the semantic tag like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section> and CSS layout techniques, especially using Flexbox and Grid.
I also integrated Font Awesome icons and focused on styling elements effectively to match the original design as closely as possible.

Overall, it was a valuable hands-on experience, and I’m excited to keep improving!
